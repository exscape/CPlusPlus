eFunge: 
A Befunge-93 interpreter using 64-bit signed integers as storage, both
in the program space and on the stack. Written several years ago, originally
for Windows. Quick and dirty port to use my stack implementation. The vast
majority of the code is still ancient.

The following classes were written for learning purposes only.

linkedlist:
A templated doubly-linked list class, similar to std::list. Supports
bidirectional iterators (iterator, const_iterator, reverse_iterator and
		const_reverse_iterator).

stack:
A simple stack class, similar to std::stack. As expected, it has very few
public, non-debug operations: push(), pop(), top(), size() and empty().

string:
A simple string class; basically a wrapper around char pointers. NOT
templated; as such, it does not support wide characters without (likely) heavy
modification. Supports random-access iterators (iterator, const_iterator,
		reverse_iterator and const_reverse_iterator).
